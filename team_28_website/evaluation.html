            <h1>List of Bugs</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>
                PID bug while implementing brightness subsystem. When implementing this analyzer using format PID, 
                we realised that the hardware somehow kept turning the led PWM high and low, instead of working on a
                 stable level. Unlike the humidity or soil moisture subsystems, brightness can be changed without any 
                 time lag and cannot be added up. That’s why our PID controller got confused and kept trying to fix it 
                 with larger and larger over fix. We fixed this bug by giving the controller output/feedback value a 
                 cap, as the led light we are using can only increase the brightness of the system, there’s no way to 
                 dim it if there’s a super bright light shining on our dark box.
              </li>
              <li>
                Humidity analyzer bug. When implementing this analyzer during testing, sometimes the DC fans will go the
                opposite direction. We found the reason is that it is trying to increase the system humidity but it is a
                piece of device that can only decrease humidity by changing air. We fixed this by setting a minimum cap for 
                our feedback on the analyzer to set the value. Our system increase system humidity based on plant and water 
                container passive evacuate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Testing bug while implementing test using <code>pytest</code> mock. The bug we met was as our <code>Sensor</code> and <code>Actuator</code> classes 
                are not compatible with our pytest mock, as we don’t have a return value or output directly. We end up testing those classes by using dummy 
                outputs and checkout the actuation of hardware and the read from sensors.
              </li>
              <li>
                The water level GUI has several blue rectangles being drawn on Canvas at the same time. This bug is due to the 
                canvas didn’t delete the original rectangle after the newer one arrived. We fixed it by deleting the previous 
                rectangle before drawing a new one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                Light sensor sometimes caused an exception to be thrown by the <code>smbus</code> library: an IO Error. After some research, 
                we concluded it is the I2C bus losing the connection with the sensor temporarily. This was a dangerous bug, as 
                it caused the program to crash and not turn off all peripherals correctly (LED remaining at the same brightness, 
                fans still spinning, if the pump was mid pumping, it may have even continued pumping and flooded the system!). 
                Our solution was to repeat the sensor reading attempts a few times, and if it still couldn't get a reading, raise 
                a <code>SensorException</code> exception, which gets caught in the main and gracefully exits the program, powering everything off.
                </p>

                Here is a picture of the system failing after losing connection to the sensor, and shutting down.

              <h3>User Interface / User Experience</h3>
              <p>
                After testing the GUI on several test users, the feedback provided demonstrated 
                that our design is simple and easy to use. All components of the GUI such as buttons, 
                scales and graphs operate without errors and had a very short response time. Many 
                users mentioned that the style of the buttons along with the consistent colour scheme
                and distinct frames for separating sections created an enjoyable user experience and
                enhanced the clarity of component indication. A key point in feedback was that users
                were able to use the system to its full potential with very few interactions which
                means that minimal effort and knowledge are required on the user's end to get farm
                information from the system.
              </p>

              <p>There were a few further extensions suggested that could help improve the system:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow buttons to change colour when the mouse is hovering above it.</li>
                <li>
                  Add more graph features - for example, allow the user to enter the number 
                  of ticks shown on the x and y-axis, or control the number of sensor information 
                  being displayed on graph animation.
                </li>
                <li>Implement a config file parser to ensure only correct files can be loaded onto the system to avoid errors.</li>
                <li>Allow for manual control of system actuation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                For the set requirements, the UI design meets all the must and should have statements,
                and is relatively similar to the original prototype produced. However, we made the 
                following changes for further improvements:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The title ‘Water Level’ for the subsystem is changed to ‘Soil Moisture’ as we believe 
                  this is a better representation of the factor affecting the plant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On the profile page, we removed the ‘View Graph’ button and fit both the sensor value 
                  label with the live graph all in one frame as this uses up frame space more efficiently 
                  and reduced user action to obtain information on the current farm state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An extra water level frame is added to the profile page for Soil Moisture with a scale 
                  diagram to inform the user of the state of the water container.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ‘System Visualisation’ section is changed to ‘System Settings’ which adds a feature
                  that allows the user to upload their configuration file for a specific plant profile.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Functionality</h3>
              <p>
                Overall, our project demonstrates a working example of how IoT devices can be controlled
                by the Raspberry Pi to produce a control system that can optimise plant growth through storing
                data on the Azure database, analysing input data and outputting PID control calculation results
                to actuators. 
              </p>

              <h3>Stability</h3>
              <p>
                All data collected from the sensors and actuators are stored on the Azure SQL database which 
                is stable and reliable. The latest version showed 99.99% availability, allowing data to 
                be safely accessed from anywhere as long as there is an internet connection. In addition, 
                due to firewalls being set up with a secure password that is kept secret with the user, stability 
                in system security is guaranteed, ensuring data stored is accurate.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our current implemented database can store up to 64MB of data. This can be easily 
                extended with Azure if needed. Also, through tests, the Raspberry Pi can run for several hours
                at once for data collection to database. Since Azure is a reliable service, we can ensure that 
                the data can be stored on cloud for as long as the needed.
              </p>

              <h3>Efficiency</h3>
              <p>
                We have designed our communication to ensure data is sent as efficiently as possible. This is done 
                using multi-threading and through the publisher-subscriber design pattern. Multithreading allows 
                PID calculations to be made in smaller time intervals than data collection intervals, allowing for 
                a more accurate output value without increasing function calls for extra, unnecessary data collection. 
                The GUI is implemented to only make one single connection with the database when the app is instantiated 
                and closes the connection when the app is closed. This is a lot more efficient than opening and closing 
                connections every time data access is needed at every regular interval which would be time-consuming.
              </p>

              <h3>Compatibility</h3>
              <p>
                The GUI is designed to display components visibly on any PC device, such as Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20.04lts)
                 and Mac (tested on MacOS Big Sur 11.6.4) with no effect on performance. However, on different devices the GUI 
                 graphics may look a little different. We implemented our project on the Raspberry Pi 4 Grove kit. However,
                 we have designed our system to work on any other versions of the Raspberry pi.
              </p>

              <h3>Maintainability</h3>
              <p>
                Our code is structured to maximise maintainability through firstly separating the front end (<code>gui_code</code>) 
                from the back end (<code>src</code>). The front end code is then grouped to have a ‘view’ module for each page. 
                For example the '<code>profile_view</code>' stores all classes required to set up the page: 
              </p>
              <img src="assets/img/evaluation/profile_view_structure.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="width:250px;height:300px;">

              <p>
                Each component, such as scale and graph, is abstracted into its class, isolating the code so that it is easier to 
                implement and add extra features if needed. Further, the ‘<code>data_streamer</code>' module is separate, containing files related 
                to database access only, which is then called by the main GUI app to obtain data. This eases the debugging process of 
                SQL queries by just looking at the <code>data_streamer</code>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Under tools, we included the <code>constants.py</code> file to store features like frame padding and text font sizes so that the 
                values are consistently used across the whole GUI system. Not only does this reduce magic numbers, but it also allows 
                features to be changed by only changing one value.
              </p>

              <p>The backend <code>src</code> is also structured into submodules:</p>

              <img src="assets/img/evaluation/src.png" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="width:250px;height:350px;">

              <p>
                For each subsystem, there is an actuator, analyser, and sensor placed in appropriate modules. To ensure messages sent 
                through pubsub is maintained, we collated all topics into a config.ini file to organise and keep track. This also ensures 
                that messages can be easily altered without going through the entire project folder.
              </p>

              <h3>Project Management</h3>

              <p>
                Our team uses Discord and Whatsapp as our main methods of communication. We use Notion to collate and share 
                our portfolio notes and list of goals. We set up weekly meetings online to review our weekly to-do list and 
                set members new tasks to complete for the following week. In addition, we use GitHub to share code, review code 
                PRs, and open new issues to set members a debugging or code enhancement task to complete. We used Visual Studio 
                Code Live Collaboration to carry out pair programming for some of the harder tasks to implement, such as sending 
                data to and from the database. Overall we followed the Gantt chart to ensure our long term goals will be completed 
                within the deadline. Every two weeks, we would write about the implementation processes in the blogs to keep 
                track of progress.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Since our project is hardware-centred, we kept the components in one member’s apartment and met up in person once 
                a week to work with it. This physically also allows us to discuss the separate parts we have worked on asynchronously 
                and try to put the sections together. As it took up some time to confirm the hardware list with our client, order them, 
                receive and assemble them, we had to plan our code implementation around the resources we have available. This meant that 
                at the beginning of the project we spent more time on research and design, as it was difficult to implement the system 
                without having all the components needed. In addition, we book weekly meetings with our client on Teams to keep him up 
                to date with our current progress and thoughts for the next steps.

              <h1>Future Work</h1>

              <p>
                One key feature in our Could-have requirements is to add an AI Camera to our system. 
                The aim is to stream images of the the plants for the system to analyse and infer 
                plant health, which can also give an insight to actuation performance in maintaining 
                optimal growth conditions. 
              </p>

              <p>
                One camera model we could use is with the <a href= "https://azure.github.io/Vision-AI-DevKit-Pages/docs/quick_start/">Microsoft AI Vision Kit by Elnfochips</a>. This 
                can be connected to any PC via internet connection and the images can be streamed using 
                VLC with the camera RTSP address. Alternatively, another way to view camera data is 
                via a physical HDMI cable. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Once a connection is made to stream a live video from AI camera to the GUI, we can apply ML. 
                Here is a list of features we can implement with ML:
              </p>    
              <ul>
                <li>Detect number of leaves in plant.</li>
                <li>Analyse the dry level of the plant.</li>
                <li>Detect plant disease symptoms such as spots.</li>
                <li>Analyse plant stress level.</li>
              </ul>   

            <img src="assets/img/evaluation/ai_camera.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Allow for more User Inputs</h3>
            <p>
              Our current GUI is designed to be easily extendable. For the options menu, we can add a scrolling feature 
              as well as more buttons for the user to select. This allows future work on the project to include many more 
              subsystems, such as soil pH level, each with its profile page with sensor and actuation information displayed. 
              Further, we could add an option for each profile page to also view a graph for actuation value over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the ‘Soil Moisture Level’ specifically, including an actuation graph would significantly improve clarity 
              in showing the user, how the pumps are being operated. The graph could have a discrete on/off value for the 
              y axis - it will take the value 1 when the pump is on and 0 when the pump is off, against time on the x-axis. 
              This would allow the user to see how long the pump has been turned on and off.
            </p>

            <p>
              Under the system settings section, we could allow the user to format the profile page to tailor to more specific 
              needs, such as allowing them to adjust the number of ticks shown on the x and y-axis of the sensor graph. The 
              number of sensor values shown on the graph could also be adjusted by a user with a slide of a given range. For 
              example, allow the user the choose between 5 and 50 sensor values to be displayed on a graph against time.
            </p>

            <p>
              For uploading a configuration file for a plant profile, we can extend the feature by allowing the user to edit 
              the file on the GUI and allow them to save and select different plant profiles. The configuration file format 
              can include a new variable called setpoint which allows the user to log specific desired setpoints for each 
              subsystem that will be sent to the Raspberry Pi for the PID mechanism to generate an appropriate response.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Scaling Up to Industry Level</h3>
            <p>
              Currently, the system only has one sensor for each subsystem, but we have structured the SQL database to include 
              sensor ID and sensor Type which allows the same sensor Type to have multiple sensor devices. This means that we 
              can ultimately have a system with hundreds of sensor devices for each subsystem placed across a large area of 
              farmland, allowing the user to monitor and control the overall state of the conditions with our system. Once 
              scaled up, our solution could help with precision farming, allowing maximum yield, and thus reach towards 
              solving the food production problems addressed to us by our client.
            </p>
            <br>


            <h3>Edge Device (Raspberry Pi) Software Improvements</h3>
            <p>Further improvements on the Edge device could include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Creating a service running the startup script in the system:
                <ul>
                  <li>This would allow the system to run without an active ssh connection, and immediately start on device boot up.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Moving the data processing to the cloud:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Currently, the system processes all data on the Edge device - mainly control of the actuators 
                    based on the sensor input using PID controllers and other methods. This could however be hugely 
                    expanded and improved.
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      With a strong internet connection, some parts of the data analysis (e.g. inferring environment 
                      status based on previous sensor and actuation values, deciding on actuation actions) could be 
                      moved out of the Raspberry Pi and to a Cloud model, trained and tested on the data generated 
                      by our system. This could be a self-improving system for tweaking PID control systems (increasing 
                      their speed and effectiveness), or even changing the target values for humidity, temperature or 
                      others, depending on the plant health/growth.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Increasing test coverage of the system.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Currently, the system is focused mainly on providing a demonstratory solution with actual hardware and 
                    living plants involved but lacks a deep and thorough test suite.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      This could be improved by wrapping all sensor and actuator classes into another level of abstraction, 
                      and creating emulated sensors and actuators, providing fake (but resembling real-life) values. This 
                      would allow for a fully digital system, without outside world dependencies (real-life sensor data), 
                      and more proper unit and coverage testing could be implemented.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Another approach could involve dockerising the Raspbian image with the emulated sensors, and running 
                      the tests during development, including them in the CI/CD workflow of the process. For example, if 
                      the project is to continue on a GitHub repository, the image with testing scripts could be built and 
                      run as a Github Action on a Pull Request.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Adding a CI/CD pipeline, including deployment using Azure IoT Edge.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The current system contains a skeleton of a CI/CD pipeline, with a GitHub action for 
                  reviewing and linting code under a PR according to PEP8 standard.
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  An improvement would be to add to the CD part: an automatic documentation deployment, and 
                  automatic deployment of the most recent program to the devices connected to the Azure IoT 
                  Hub using Azure IoT Edge. Improving the CI part could include adding dockerised Rpi Image 
                  building and running Unit Tests on Pull Requests.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>
